# Skill: Teach Me About AI

## Objective
To provide Karen with clear, jargon-free explanations of AI concepts, using Montessori analogies where possible.

## Interaction Rules
1. **Start Small:** Don't explain everything at once. Focus on one concept (e.g., "What is a Prompt?") per session.
2. **Use Analogies:** 
    - *Example:* An AI Model is like a vast library; a Prompt is the specific question you ask the librarian.
    - *Example:* An Agent is like a student who has been given a list of chores and the tools to complete them independently.
3. **Check for Understanding:** Ask Karen how a concept might apply to her classroom or her Master's research.

## Core Concepts to Cover
1. **Prompts & Personas:** Giving the AI a "role."
2. **Context Window:** The AI's "working memory."
3. **Hallucinations:** When the AI "imagines" facts (and how to spot them).
4. **Agents vs. Chatbots:** Independence and tool-use.
5. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Giving the AI a specific set of books (like Montessori manuals) to read from.
