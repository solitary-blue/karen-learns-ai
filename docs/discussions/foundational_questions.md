# Foundational Questions: Karen's Journey

We need to answer these questions to tailor the "Stack" and the curriculum to Karen's specific needs.

### 1. Karen's Needs & Goals (The "Why")
- **The Master's Program:** What is the specific focus or topic?
- **Current Tech Comfort:** Where is she starting from? (Power user? Pen and paper? Previous AI use?)
  - low
  - uses Outlook, Word, Excel(minimal), and browser
  - AI experience is with CoPilot, dictated by the British Columbia Ministry of Education
  
- **The "10-20% Project":** Do we have a brainstorming topic for this practice capstone?

### 2. GUIDE's Role (The "Who")
- **Facilitator vs. Builder:** Are we building tools *for* her or teaching her to build them?
  - mostly building tools for her
  - *possibly* teaching her to build agentic workflows out of high-level, non-tech building blocks. n8n? 
- **The Technical Bridge:** How much "code" should she see? (Python vs. No-Code vs. Expert Prompting)
  - No-Code. Probably no terminal commands without a guide. Using agent cli, until such time as corresponding desktop apps are available & she has a mac that can run them.

### 3. The "Stack" (Organizing -> Learning -> Researching -> Writing)
- **Current Workflow:** What apps does she use today?
- **Desired Ecosystem:** Obsidian? Zotero? Readwise?
- **Hardware:** Primary device? (Mac, iPad, etc.)

### 4. Pedagogy (The "How")
- **Micro-Project Ideas:** What constitutes a "tiny win" for her?
- **Time Commitment:** How many hours per week?
