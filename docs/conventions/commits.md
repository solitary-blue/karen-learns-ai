# Git Client for Karen

Since Karen is non-technical, we recommend using a visual client to view the project history without needing the command line.

### Recommendation: **SourceTree**
- **Why:** It is free, has a clean visual interface, and clearly shows the history of "who did what" and "what changed."
- **Use Case:** Karen can use this to see the `research`, `write`, and `learn` commits made by her and her agents.
