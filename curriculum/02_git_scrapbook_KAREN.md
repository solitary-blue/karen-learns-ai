# Exercise 2: Your Project's Time Machine

Welcome, Karen! Today we are looking at **Git**. 

Think of Git as a **Digital Scrapbook**. Every time we finish a thought or a piece of work, your AI assistant will "paster" it into this scrapbook. This means you can never "break" your project—we can always turn back the pages to a version that worked!

## Phase 1: Seeing the Scrapbook
Open the app called **SourceTree**. Look at the dots and lines. This is the history of everything we've built together so far!

## Phase 2: Doing some Work
Let's add something personal to our project. 
**Action:** Type a message to your Agent in the chat:
> "Hi! Can you create a file called `projects/my_notes.md` and add my favorite Montessori quote: 'Follow the child'?"

**Action:** Once the agent says they've "Saved" it, ask:
> "Where are we?"

Look at the response. Notice the **Time Machine Code** in brackets like `[a1b2c]`. This is like a unique page number. You can ask: "Tell me more about [that code]" if you ever want to know exactly what was changed!

## Phase 3: The "What-If" Experiment
Sometimes you have an idea but you aren't sure if it's right. In Git, we call this a **Branch**. It's like taking a separate sheet of paper to try an idea.

**Action:** Tell your Agent:
> "I'm not sure about this, but let's try an experiment. Can you rewrite my quote to be about 'Spontaneous Activity' instead?"

## Phase 4: Choosing your Path
Now that we've seen two versions, we can pick the one we like best and "merge" it into our main scrapbook.

**Action:** Tell your Agent:
> "I like the 'Spontaneous Activity' version best. Can you make that our main version?"
