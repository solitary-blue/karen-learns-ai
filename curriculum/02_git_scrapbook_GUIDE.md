# Exercise 2: The Digital Scrapbook (GUIDE PLAN)

**Goal:** Introduce Git, SourceTree, and Agentic Committing.
**Duration:** 20-40 minutes.
**Format:** Collaborative sitting with Karen.

## 1. The Concept (5 mins)
- **Analogy:** Git is like a "Digital Scrapbook" or "Time Machine."
- **Why we use it:** To save our work so we never lose anything, and to try "what-if" ideas (Experiments) without messing up our main project.
- **The Agent's Role:** You (Karen) do the work; the Agent (AI) does the "pasting" into the scrapbook for you.

## 2. SourceTree Tour (5 mins)
- Open SourceTree.
- Point out the "Main" line (the timeline).
- Explain that every "dot" is a moment in time we saved.

## 3. Collaborative Work (10 mins)
- Have Karen open `projects/karen-prototype/lesson_plan_agent.py` or a new file.
- Ask the Agent to add a specific Montessori quote or a "Welcome" message to the project.
- Watch the Agent commit.
- **Show in SourceTree:** Point out the new dot and the "tech" or "ai" prefix.

## 4. The "Experiment" Branch (10 mins)
- Suggest trying a "Risky Idea" (e.g., "What if we rewrote this for toddlers?").
- Guide Karen to ask the Agent: "Let's try an experiment: rewrite this lesson for a 3-year-old."
- **Observe:** Agent creates a branch, does the work, and commits.
- **SourceTree:** Show the branch splitting off.

## 5. The Choice & The Merge (10 mins)
- Switch back to `main`. Show her that the "toddler" work is "gone" (safe on the other pad).
- Try a second experiment (e.g., "for teenagers").
- Have Karen pick her favorite.
- Ask the Agent to "Make this our main version."
- **SourceTree:** Observe the "Merge Bubble" closing.
