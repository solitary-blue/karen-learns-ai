# Exercise 3: How your AI Assistant "Remembers"

Welcome back, Karen! Today we're learning about how your AI assistant thinks and what happens when it "takes a nap" (restarts).

## The Working Notepad
Think of our current conversation as a **Working Notepad**. I can see everything we've talked about today, which helps me stay helpful. 

**But there's a catch:** When this session ends or if the program is restarted, my notepad is thrown away! I start the next time with a "Fresh Mind."

## The Permanent Scrapbook
This is why we use **Git** and the **Projects folder**. 
- Anything we put into a file (like your lesson plans or research) is like writing in a **Permanent Ledger**.
- Even if I "forget" our conversation, I can always look at the files in your folder to see exactly where we left off.

## The Rule of Persistence
If we talk about a great idea and you want to make sure I don't forget it next time:
**Action:** Always ask me to "Save this to my projects" or "Put this in my notes."

**Action for Today:**
Ask me: 
> "What is the most important thing you've learned about my project today? Please save it to a file called `projects/persistence_check.md` so you remember it after your restart!"
