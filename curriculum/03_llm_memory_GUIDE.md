# Exercise 3: How LLMs "Remember" (GUIDE PLAN)

**Goal:** Understand the difference between session memory (Context) and persistent storage (The Scrapbook/Disk).
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes.

## 1. The "Short-Term Memory" Analogy (5 mins)
- Explain that the AI has a "Working Notepad" (the current chat).
- It can see everything we've talked about *in this session*, but it's like writing in pencil on a small pad.
- **The Limit:** Eventually, the pad gets full, or if we "restart" the app, the notepad is thrown away.

## 2. The "Long-Term Record" (5 mins)
- Contrast the notepad with the **Digital Scrapbook** (Git).
- Anything written into a file and "Saved" (Committed) is like writing in ink in a permanent ledger.
- Even if the AI's notepad is wiped clean (Restart), it can "read" the ledger to remember who you are and what we are building.

## 3. Why we Restart (5 mins)
- Explain that sometimes the notepad gets too messy or "cluttered."
- Restarting gives the AI a "Fresh Mind," but only if we've been diligent guides who save the important bits to the scrapbook first.

## 4. Discussion
- Ask Karen: "If you have a great idea for a lesson plan while talking to the AI, what should you make sure happens before we stop for the day?"
- Answer: "The AI should save it to a file in the projects folder!"
